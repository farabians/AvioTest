                    <p>In this test, you control a ball inside a maze. The maze has four entrances and different symmetry layouts. A ball starts from one entrance and moves based on your inputs. Your task is to guide the ball to the empty center area as fast as possible.</p>

                                <p>The spatial orientation test is designed as a challenge of spotting patterns when you are under pressure, focusing more on how you perceive things than on pre-existing knowledge. The test is essentially a puzzle where the goal is to win.</p>
                                <p><strong>The Test Environment and Objective</strong><br>
                                The basic environment involves controlling a ball that is inside a maze. Each maze is constructed around a specific symmetrical layout and features four possible entrances, with the ball starting at one of them. Your single objective is to guide that ball right into the center of the maze, and the critical requirement is to get there as fast as you possibly can.</p>
                                <p><strong>The Golden Rule: Symmetry</strong><br>
                                Speed and accuracy are managed by mastering the "secret weapon": symmetry. Understanding symmetry is the absolute golden rule of this test. In this context, symmetry functions as a rule of movement: When you move your ball, a second ball in another maze moves at the exact same time. This second ball mirrors what you do based on a hidden symmetrical pattern. The critical implication is that you are not just solving one maze; you must get both of those balls into the center of their mazes simultaneously. Importantly, every single maze in this test follows the exact same symmetry rule, meaning that once the pattern is figured out, you can rely on it.</p>
                                <p><strong>Rules of Engagement and Strategy</strong><br>
                                The test is a race against the clock. Every maze has a strict time limit, which is shown right before the maze starts to give you a moment to prepare. The core challenge is a constant balancing act: you must be fast to beat the clock, but accurate to actually solve the puzzle. Moving too quickly and making a mistake will cost significantly more time than taking a moment to think. The winning strategy revolves around processing the puzzle quickly with your brain, rather than focusing on the speed of your hands. The main goal, before even making a single move, is to look at the board and truly understand the symmetrical pattern that is in play. Once that pattern is seen, the rest is simply execution—applying the logic to guide both balls efficiently. The core principle for success is to understand first, then move. The key to cracking the code is being able to see the pattern before you even make your first move.</p>
