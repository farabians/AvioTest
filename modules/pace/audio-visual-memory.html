                    <h2>Test Description</h2>
                    <p>At the start of each question, you will see several corridors on the screen.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two corridors are marked in red</li>
                        <li>Red corridors are occupied and cannot be used</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then, you will hear audio commands.</p>
                    <p>Each command includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A city name</li>
                        <li>A corridor number</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If a corridor mentioned in the audio command was not red at the start, that corridor is valid.</p>
                    <p>This means the city connected to that corridor is a valid city.</p>
                    <p>If the corridor is red, it is occupied and cannot be used.</p>

                                <p>All right, today we're going to tackle a really critical test. The audiovisual memory test. You know, it's designed to push your multitasking, your memory, and your precision right to the limit. And we're going to break down exactly how you can master it. So, how does this thing actually work? Well, this test is really all about your brain's ability to handle two completely separate streams of information. What you see and what you hear at the same time, and yeah, under pressure. Let's get right into it.</p>
                                <p>The test really has two main parts. So, for right now, let's focus only on the visuals. Pay attention only to what pops up on the screen at the very start of each question. First, you're going to see a bunch of corridors. Your first job is to spot the two that are colored red.</p>
                                <p>And finally, you have to lock this one rule into your memory. Red means that the corridor is occupied. So, just remember this. If a corridor is red, it's a nogo zone. It's blocked. It's occupied. It is totally offlimits.</p>
                                <p>Okay, now let's layer in the audio. Every single audio command has exactly two pieces of information: a city name and a corridor number. That's it. Your job is to catch that pair. So, you might hear something like Berlin, corridor 4. You've got to register both parts of that.</p>
                                <p>When you hear a corridor number called out, you have to instantly ask yourself, wait, was that corridor red at the beginning? If it was clear, boom, that's a valid path. If it were red, then it's invalid. Simple as that.</p>
                                <p>On that final screen, you'll select only the cities that were assigned to a valid non- red corridor. Which means you can fly to those cities from the valid, non-red corridors.</p>
                                <p>Finally, let's just quickly cover the structure of the test itself. You know, the specific rules of engagement. Knowing these key numbers and phases is going to help you manage your focus and your expectations as you go through it. First up, remember this number. There will always be exactly two red corridors at the start of every question. Not one, not three, always two. You can use that as a constant to help you out.</p>
                                <p>So, there you have it. the visual rules, the audio commands, and the mission structure. At its core, this test is a direct measure of your ability to maintain situational awareness under pressure. You now have everything you need to understand the challenge. So, the only question left is, are you ready to fly?</p>
