                    <h2>How it works</h2>
                    <p>You will see a sequence of numbers shown one by one on the screen. Numbers range from 1 to 9. Your task is to remember only certain numbers based on a simple rule:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Numbers appear one after another.</li>
                        <li>You compare each new number with the previous number.</li>
                        <li>If the new number is <strong>higher</strong>, you keep it in mind.</li>
                        <li>If the new number is <strong>lower</strong>, you ignore it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="note-box" style="margin: 20px 0;">
                        <h4>Example:</h4>
                        <p>7 → 6 → <strong>ignore 6</strong></p>
                        <p>6 → 7 → <strong>keep 7</strong></p>
                        <p>7 → 6 → <strong>ignore 6</strong></p>
                        <p>6 → 8 → <strong>keep 8</strong></p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">At the end, you are asked to enter the numbers you kept, in the correct order.</p>

                                <p>Welcome. Today, we're going to crack the code on a memory test that can seem pretty tough: the AIO test digit span. But here's the secret. It really all just comes down to one simple rule. So, let me ask you, are you ready for a memory challenge? Cuz that's exactly what this is. And if you stick with me, by the end of this, you'll have the key to absolutely mastering it. All right. First up, what even is the digit span test? Well, at its core, it's a really clever test that's designed to measure two key things: your short-term memory and, maybe even more importantly, your ability to pay super close attention. Okay, so here's the setup. You're going to see a sequence of numbers, just one through nine, and they'll flash on the screen one by one. But here's the catch. Your job isn't to remember all of them. Nope. You only have to remember specific numbers based on that one simple rule. That's why it's a test of selective attention just as much as it is a test of memory.</p>
                                <p>And that brings us to the most important part of this whole thing. The entire test. And I mean, no matter how crazy long the number sequence gets, it all comes down to one simple rule. This is the absolute key. This is it right here. This is the one phrase you need to burn into your brain. If the new number is higher, you keep it. If it's lower, you ignore it. Just think of it as your mantra for the test. Higher, keep, lower, ignore. That's literally all you need to know. So, let's break that down into a quick mental checklist you can run for every single number that pops up. Step one, see the number. Step two, compare it to the one that appeared right before it. Step three, is it higher? If it is, boom, you lock it into your memory. Step four, is it lower? If so, you just let it go. Poof, gone. All right, theory is great and all, but let's actually see an example in action.</p>
                                <p>We're going to walk through a short sequence together, step by step, so you can see exactly how this works in real time. Okay, so imagine the test is starting right now. Your sequence is beginning. eyes on the screen and get ready to apply that rule. The first number that appears is a seven. Now, since it's the very first one, there's nothing to compare it to yet, right? So, it just kind of sets our initial benchmark. Next up, we see a six. Okay, time for that mental checklist. We compare this new number six to the previous one, which was seven. So, is six higher or lower than seven? It's lower, of course. So, our rule is crystal clear. We ignore it. The number six is now totally irrelevant, you just discard it from your memory completely. Forget you ever saw it. And here comes the next one, an eight. Now, listen up, cuz this is probably the most important part of the whole strategy. What do you compare this eight to? You do not compare it to the seven from the beginning.</p>
                                <p>You compare it to the last number that appeared on screen, which was the six. So, is eight higher than six? You bet it is. And that means we keep the eight. So, our mental list of kept numbers now has an eight in it. See, it's always about the very last number you saw, not the last number you kept. So then once the full sequence is over, the test will ask you to enter just the numbers you decided to keep. And you have to put them in the exact order you kept them. And that's it. That's the final step of any question. So now that you've got the core strategy down, let's zoom out a little bit. What does the full test actually look like? Here's what you should expect when it's go time. The entire graded part of the test is actually pretty short. It's just eight questions total, but there's a definite structure to it. The main thing you need to know is that with each question, the sequence of numbers gets longer.</p>
                                <p>So, it starts out pretty simple and then gradually gets more and more challenging. It's really designed to test the limits of your focus. Another really key thing to understand is the difference between the training phase and, you know, the real deal. The whole experience is broken into two very distinct parts. So, before the exam officially kicks off, you get a training phase. This is your chance to get comfortable with the whole thing. You'll do a few short practice questions. They're not graded. And the system actually helps you learn the rule. And then comes the exam phase. Eight graded questions. That increasing difficulty we talked about and no help. You're on your own. Just you and that one simple rule. So the most crucial point here is this. No matter how long that sequence gets or how much pressure you're feeling, the rule never ever changes. Higher you keep, lower you ignore. That is your anchor through this entire test. And that's it.</p>
                                <p>That's the whole secret to crack the digit span. The method is simple. The rule is clear. So the only question left is now that you know the rule, how will you perform?</p>
